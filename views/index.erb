            <p>Personauth is a self-hostable, external auth service. Spiritual successor to Browserid/Persona, it enables sites to have user logins without storing passwords.</p>

        <% if ! authorized? %>
            <%= render_login_button %>
        <% else %>
            <section>You are logged in as <%= authorized_email %> <form id="logout" action="<%= url '/logout' %>" method="POST"><button type="submit">Logout</button></form></section>
            <section id="explanation">
