            <p>Portier is a self-hostable, external auth service. Spiritual successor to Browserid/Persona, it enables sites to have user logins without storing passwords.</p><p>Users log in by showing that they control the email adress.</p>

                    <p>You saw what happened. Actually, you know more than me. Depending on the email adress entered, you either got a confirmation email and had to click on a link, or you got presented an OpenID auth-dialog of your mail hoster that asked for confirmation.</p>

                    <p>It is supposed to decide automatically the best available option.</p>
